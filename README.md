# Smart Food Delivery UI
Smart Food Delivery System is designed to more efficiently route the donation food from food donors to food kitchens with the help from volunteers. 

Food donors are local restaurants and bakeries who want to donate high-quality food on a daily basis. This application provides an user interface (UI) to add food donors into the system. The donor calendar feature allows each food donor to create and update their daily donation schedule and quantity.

Food kitchens benefit the community by ensuring that those who are food insecure have access to it. Kitchens are divided into groups based on their proximity. The concept of a kitchen group is crucial because it allows kitchens in one group to agree to cross-donate food based on inventory. In the event that a kitchen has excess food, the kitchen admin can reduce its food need to 0 and the food scheduled for that kitchen can be donated to another kitchen within the same group. Admins can register a kitchen and add it to a group using this application. The calendar feature allows each food kitchen to create and update their daily needs and quantity.

The volunteer profile page displays the volunteer's email, picture, and statistics, as well as information on previous and upcoming food delivery activities. With the dashboard page, admins can also keep track of the number of food donors, food kitchens, volunteers who are actively helping and the overall amount of food that was donated.

The most important and distinctive feature of the system is its capability to automatically reroute food donations from one kitchen to another within a group.  Because the system has information on the required item and quantity for each kitchen, the food donation item and quantity for each donor, it can dynamically compute which kitchen is most suited for receiving the food donation.  If there are any changes to the food delivery schedule, volunteers will be notified as soon as possible so that they can ensure that the most in needy kitchens receives the food donation.
